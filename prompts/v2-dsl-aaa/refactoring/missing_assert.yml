SmellType: "Missing Assert"
Description: "A test method performs an action (the Act) but lacks any assertions to verify the outcome. A test without assertions is not a real test, as it cannot fail."
Variables:
  TargetMethodName: "The name of the method being tested (the 'Act' part)."
  ReturnValue: "The object or value returned by the target method."
  StateChangingObject: "The object whose state is modified by the 'Act'."
Steps:
  - Description: "Identify the primary 'Act' of the test, which is the method call that changes state or produces a result."
    Action: "IdentifyAction"
    Parameters:
      SourcePattern: "Find the main method invocation that is not part of the setup."
  
  - Description: "Add one or more assertions to verify the outcome of the 'Act'. This could be checking a return value, or verifying the new state of an object."
    Action: "AddAssertion"
    Parameters:
      TargetMethod: "The original test method."
      AssertionPattern: "Based on the action, add a standard assertion. For example: assertEquals(expected, {ReturnValue}); or assertTrue({StateChangingObject}.isSomething());"

Example:
  Before: |
    @Test
    public void testAddItemToCart() {
        // Arrange
        Cart cart = new Cart();
        Item item = new Item("apple", 1.00);
        
        // Act
        cart.addItem(item);
    }
  After: |
    @Test
    public void testAddItemToCart() {
        // Arrange
        Cart cart = new Cart();
        Item item = new Item("apple", 1.00);
        
        // Act
        cart.addItem(item);
        
        // Assert
        assertEquals(1, cart.size());
        assertTrue(cart.contains(item));
    }
