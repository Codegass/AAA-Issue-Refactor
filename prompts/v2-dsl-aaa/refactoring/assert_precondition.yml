SmellType: "Assert Pre-condition"
Description: "The test contains an assertion in the Arrange block, before the Act block. These assertions check the state of the test environment rather than the outcome of the test itself. They should be replaced with an 'assume' statement."
Variables:
  PreconditionAssertBlock: "The block of one or more assertions in the Arrange section."
Steps:
  - Description: "Identify any assertion statements that exist before the main 'Act' of the test method."
    Action: "IdentifyBlock"
    Parameters:
      SourcePattern: "Find calls to 'assertEquals', 'assertTrue', etc., that appear before the primary method invocation being tested."

  - Description: "Replace the precondition assertion block with a JUnit 'Assume.assume...' call. This ensures the test is skipped if the precondition is not met, rather than failing."
    Action: "ReplaceBlock"
    Parameters:
      TargetPattern: "{PreconditionAssertBlock}"
      ReplacementPattern: "Assume.assumeTrue(condition); // Or Assume.assumeNotNull(...), etc."

  - Description: "Add the required import for the Assume API if it's not already present - THIS IS MANDATORY."
    Action: "AddImport"
    Parameters:
      Import: "org.junit.Assume"

RequiredImports:
  - "org.junit.Assume"

ImportInstructions: |
  CRITICAL: You MUST include the following import in your "Refactored Test Case Additional Import Packages" section:
  - org.junit.Assume
  
  This import is required for the Assume.assumeTrue() and other assumption methods to work.
  For JUnit 5 projects, use org.junit.jupiter.api.Assumptions instead.

Example:
  Before: |
    @Test
    public void testDataProcessing() {
        // Arrange
        Service service = new Service();
        assertTrue("Service should be connected before test", service.isConnected());

        // Act
        Result result = service.processData();

        // Assert
        assertNotNull(result);
    }
  After: |
    @Test
    public void testDataProcessing() {
        // Arrange
        Service service = new Service();
        Assume.assumeTrue("Service should be connected before test", service.isConnected());

        // Act
        Result result = service.processData();

        // Assert
        assertNotNull(result);
    }
  RequiredImports: |
